# Language Models

The vanilla LMs to be fine-tuned should be in this directory.

The bash scripts download different models from the HuggingFace Hub.

As an example, to downlowad the RoBERTa-large model simply run:
```console
bash download_roberta_large.sh
```
This should create a new directory (i.e. roberta-large) with the model checkpoint and all the necessary files.
